# Aurora_store-Online_transaction_processing

This project is focused on creating an online transaction processing(OLTP) database for an online clothing retail store. After collating the data, I segmented the data into two tables/categories: online_order and online_transaction with necessary column constraints, primary keys and data types. The script for this database was extracted from the query editor and converted into PDF format.
